# Client-and-Server-using-TCP-with-UDP
A basic client server program in which TCP is used to perform a handshake and then UDP is used to transfer data.

## Execution
To begin, compile the code and generate two object files - server and client. Then, the programs can be executed in the terminal by running the server in a terminal first followed by the client in another terminal. 

The two programs can be exectured like so:
```bash
server <n_port>
```
```bash
client <server_address> <n_port> <file_name>
```
